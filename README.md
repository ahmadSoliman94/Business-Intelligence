### **1. Descriptive Analytics:** 

 + ### Descriptive analytics is often considered the first start in data analytics. Descriptive analytics takes massive amounts of historical data and turns it into digestible chunks. It is the process of deciphering what happened in the past and turning it into something interpretable for the past. It can be helpful to understand past behaviors and consider future outcomes. Most descriptive analytics falls in line with statistical modeling.
 > - (Using Visualizations and Reports).

<br />

### **2. Descriptive Analytics:**
+ ### Businesses can leverage predictive analytics by using statistics, computational modeling and machine learning to identify new sources of data and competitive insights. Using historical data as a guideline with a known set of outcomes, patterns can be found to predict future actions with a surprising degree of accuracy. It enables the business to forecast on what may happen in the future based on probabilities. Think of this data type as information that can be rolled back into multiple channels for the business. We have seen it leveraged in financial modeling, supply chain, logistics and transportation, productivity monitoring, order processing, and more. It offers the business a means to provide actionable insights with your data.

### **3. Prescriptive Analytics**
- ### Prescriptive analytics goes even further than descriptive and predictive analytics by allowing a data analyst or scientist to “prescribe” on possible outcomes through data insights, such as past business outcomes, new algorithms, and advanced statistical modeling. You can leverage data and prescriptive analytics to predict trends, future behavior patterns, and finally provide business decision trees to take full advantage of your data insights.

## **What are Dashboards:**
### A Power BI dashboard is a single page, often called a canvas, that uses visualizations to tell a story. Because it is limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the most-important elements of that story. The visualizations you see on the dashboard are called tiles and are pinned to the dashboard from reports.

4. ### How to create columns. ✅
5. ### How to remove duplicates. ✅
6. ### How to unpivot columns and  split them. ✅

> ___NOTE:___  The `PIVOT` is used to convert table rows into columns, while the `UNPIVOT` converts columns back to rows.

>To finde `Unpivot Columns` we need to go to `Transform`.

7. ### How to change Data type and replace values. ✅
8. ### How to append and merge Queries by combine the files into one. (States file into one) ✅

> ___NOTE___:  
 **- Append:** means results of two (or more) queries (which are tables themselves) will be combined into one query.\
**- Merge:** is another type of combining queries which are based on matching rows, rather than columns. The output of Merge will be a single query
